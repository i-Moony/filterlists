! As far as I understand, apiary is some kind of inner library for creating reactive pages used at Yandex. I use it's properties to detect blocks that should be removed

! Removes any div that matches '@monetize' apiary namespace. Currently there are no useful blocks matching that. 
market.yandex.ru##div[data-apiary-widget-name*="@monetize/"]

! Remove header promo
market.yandex.ru##div[data-apiary-widget-name="@marketfront/MadvHeaderPromo"]
